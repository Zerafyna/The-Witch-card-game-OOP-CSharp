# The Witch 

It is a card game for C# OOP project.

*The Witch is a russian card game.*

- **The deck:** 35 cards (from 6 to Ace, Queen of clubs is out the deck to not pair the Queen of spades)
- **The players:** 2-5 (for this game only 2 players are available)


## Game Rules
To see the gameplay please check out the [video](/TheWitch_Video.mp4).

- All the cards are dealt between the players. All the pair cards (ex. six of hearts and six of clubs) are thrown out from the hand. Player who has less cards in the hand has the first turn.
- The player picks a card from another player without looking. Each time the player gets a card that would make a pair he/she will take them away from the hand. Then it is the next playerâ€™s turn. He/she does the sane thing. It repeats until there is one card left in the game and it is the Queen of spade. The player with the card loses the game.
- When the Queen of spade was picked from your opponents hand all the cards in your hand are shuffled.
